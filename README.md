<h1>FundRaiser - Crowdfund Project</h1>

<h2>Business Case Description</h2>
<p>You have been given the opportunity to work for a big client. The task at hand is to create a crowdfunding platform (like KickStarter or Indiegogo) for the Web where one, the Project Creator, could share their wildest idea and others, the backers, could contribute financially to see it happening.</p>
<p>The Project Creator promotes his idea through a custom project profile page where he can add a project title, Description, photos, videos and post status updates, whenever necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the Project Creator should be able to track the project's financial progress through his Dashboard page. To motivate backers to contribute, he/she should offer a number of funding packages where each package is accompanied by a reward to the backer.</p>
<p>A backer should be able to browse all Projects and invest on any one he wishes. He can find Projects either through plain text search or by browsing by category, and he should be able to view the site's trending projects. He/she should also be able to view the projects he funded and observe their progress.</p>
<p>Your client wishes to create a proof of concept of the application, with separate screens for the Project Creator and the backer (authorization not required for the proof of concept), enabling him to showcase it's usage to Angel Investors to receive funding.</p>
